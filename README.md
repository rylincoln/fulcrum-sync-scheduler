# fulcrum-sync-scheduler
sync only specific forms from your fulcrum org on a schedule

create a .env file to hold the private parameters

only tested on node 10.x running on ubuntu 18.04 and postgresql 10.x

a fulcrum app that users can configure app names and app ids in(really just need the app id but that's hard for a person to understand when configuring in Fulcrum front end).
